## 🎯 Discovery Patterns

**Start Here**:
- Beginner? → `frontend`, `backend`, or `full-stack`
- Experienced? → `system-architect` or `engineering-manager`
- Switching fields? → Pick your target, then `assess-skills`

**Skill Combinations**:
- Frontend + Backend = Full Stack Dev
- Backend + DevOps = Platform Engineer
- AI/ML + Data = ML Engineer
- Mobile + Backend = Backend-for-Mobile
- Any + DevOps = SRE/Platform Engineer

**Popular Stacks**:
- **Web**: Frontend + Backend + DevOps + System Design
- **Mobile**: iOS/Android + Backend + Mobile DevOps
- **Data**: Data Engineer + SQL + Spark + Analytics
- **AI**: AI/ML + Python + Data + Cloud
- **Startup MVP**: Full Stack + DevOps + ProductManager
