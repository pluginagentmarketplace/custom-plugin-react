# Mobile Developer

Build exceptional mobile applications for iOS and Android platforms.

## What This Agent Does

The Mobile Developer agent guides you through:
- **Native Development**: Swift for iOS, Kotlin for Android
- **Cross-Platform Frameworks**: React Native, Flutter for code reuse
- **Mobile UI Design**: Platform guidelines, responsive layouts, animations
- **Native APIs**: Camera, location, notifications, sensors
- **Performance**: App startup time, memory management, battery optimization
- **Testing**: Unit tests, integration tests, device testing
- **App Distribution**: App Store, Google Play deployment and publishing
- **Security**: Encryption, secure storage, permission handling

## Learning Path

1. **Mobile Fundamentals** (Weeks 1-2)
   - Mobile platform ecosystems (iOS vs Android)
   - Mobile development workflow and tooling
   - Debugging and testing on devices
   - Performance considerations

2. **Platform Choice** (Weeks 3-6)
   - **Native Path**: Swift/iOS or Kotlin/Android
   - **Cross-Platform Path**: React Native or Flutter
   - UI frameworks and design patterns
   - State management for mobile

3. **Advanced Features** (Weeks 7-10)
   - Native module bridge (for cross-platform)
   - Camera, location, push notifications
   - Offline data sync and storage
   - Background processing

4. **Release & Maintenance** (Weeks 11-12)
   - App Store and Play Store deployment
   - Version management and updates
   - User analytics and crash reporting
   - A/B testing and user feedback

## Technology Stack

| Category | Native | Cross-Platform |
|----------|--------|-----------------|
| **iOS** | Swift, Xcode | React Native, Flutter |
| **Android** | Kotlin, Android Studio | React Native, Flutter |
| **UI** | SwiftUI, Jetpack Compose | React Native UI, Flutter widgets |
| **State** | SwiftUI State, ViewModel | Redux, Provider, GetX |
| **Networking** | URLSession, Alamofire | Fetch, Dio, http |
| **Storage** | Core Data, Realm | SharedPreferences, Hive |

## Native vs Cross-Platform

**Native Development**
- ✅ Best performance
- ✅ Full platform access
- ✅ Best user experience
- ❌ Requires two codebases

**Cross-Platform (React Native, Flutter)**
- ✅ Single codebase
- ✅ Faster development
- ✅ Code reuse
- ❌ Platform limitations

## Common Challenges

- **Performance**: Managing memory, efficient rendering, fast startup
- **Fragmentation**: Testing across devices and OS versions
- **Navigation**: Implementing complex navigation patterns
- **Native Integration**: Bridging with platform-specific features
- **Distribution**: Navigating App Store review processes

## Learning Resources

- **iOS**: Apple Developer docs, Swift.org, RayWenderlich
- **Android**: Android Developer docs, Kotlin.org, Android Authority
- **React Native**: React Native docs, Expo, React Native School
- **Flutter**: Flutter.dev, Google Codelabs, Flutter Community
- **Practice**: BuildWithSwift, Android samples, FlutterByExample
